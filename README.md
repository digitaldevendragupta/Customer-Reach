Customer Reach

I know a lot of cafe and restaurant owners who opt in boosting ads because it's less complicated and easy to navigate.

While that is true, there's so much potential wasted when you boost posts instead of running ads in the Facebook ads manager. 🤯

Posts that are boosted on Facebook are simply regular posts that you pay to reach a wider audience.

Your post will be seen by more users, or seen more often by users who are likely to engage with it. 👀

But there's a possibility that your post might be seen by an audience who are not interested in your offer.

So, if you want your money to be efficiently used, run ads on the Facebook ads manager. 🍂
